##  Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the GitHub organization of the  CMEMS Arctic-BLISS project  

### About
__Arctic-BLISS__  (__Arctic__ atmospheric **B**oundary **L**ayer **I**nfluence in **S**ea ice ensemble **S**imulations: _a predictability & sensitivity study_, 2024-2026) is a project funded by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) of the European Union, led by Stephanie Leroux from Datlas, in collaboration with P. Rampal and J.-M. Brankart from IGE, Y. Ying, L. Bertino and E. Olason from NERSC and F. LemariÃ© from INRIA.

The goal is to evaluate the short-term predictability of sea ice drift in an model integrating three innovative elements of future operational CMEMS systems: 
* a brittle/fracture rheology (e.g., Ã“lason et al. 2022),
* the coupling of the ocean-sea-ice model with an interactive atmospheric boundary layer (ABL, LemariÃ© et al. 2021),
* and an ensemble modeling framework following e.g. Leroux et al 2020.

Metrics dedicated to sea ice drift, ensemble simulations, and a cross-validation approach will be combined to address the questions of sea ice drift predictability for a given initial error, and how the activation of an interactive ABL, with or without brittle rheology, can affect the quality and accuracy of the forecasting system.

### Webpage
The project has just started, but we will soon have a [nice web page to check  out](https://cmems-arcticbliss.github.io/)!

### Code, data, publications
The project is just starting, but as soon as we have science, codes, data produced as part of the project, we will post and document them here.
